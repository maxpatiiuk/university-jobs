# university_jobs
This repository presents a list of jobs available at the University of Kansas for all students. Also, I have added salary to every listing and attached a code that extracts all the data from https://employment.ku.edu

[Google sheet table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K5ziTbkc8qCPVu4iGP7iXRZd01KQfoNR8vNsCl3YUcs/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to use the script, you need to open [KU Jobs website](https://employment.ku.edu/job-search/student), insert [jQuery libriary code](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js) and [js script](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/university_jobs/blob/master/script.js) into DevTools console. The result will be shown as a json by console.log and will also be stored as an array in "data" variable.
